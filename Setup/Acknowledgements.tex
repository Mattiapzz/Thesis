\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Professor Francesco Biral for his dedication and the huge amount of time and the late evenings that he spent to assist my work.\\

I would also like to thank Professor Enrico Bertolazzi, his office door was always open whenever I ran into a trouble spot or had a question about optimal control or about PINS.\\
%
I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.\\

Most importantly, I wish to thank my loving and supportive girlfriend, Sara. She provides me unending inspiration and never let me down.\\

Finally, I would like to thanks all my friends and flatmates for all the fun and support given in the past years.\\
