\chapter{Optimal Control Initialization}
\label{Ch:OCIni}
%
The problem of initialization of optimal control is of great importance for the convergence or even the existence of a solution of the problem. However, for some unknown reasons, the academic literature lacks of a deep investigation and discussion on this topic. Most of the time is given for granted or even ignore. In this chapter, the authors tries to give an overview on how the control problem can be initialised and the role played by each therm. Most of the time, the author, will refer to the equation \ref{eq:GenOCP}. Moreover, in the next section, a general idea and definition of continuation is given.
