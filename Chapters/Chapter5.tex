%
Once the model is fully formulated the OCP can be build around it. The focus of this thesis is to compute minimum time manoeuvres, therefore the OCP must be constructed following some specific steps depending on the method chosen. In this work the OCP is solved using indirect method through the software PINS \cite{bertolazzi2006symbolic}. In the following section the whole process is explained in details.
