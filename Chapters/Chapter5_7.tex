\section{Summary of the addressed problems}
%
This study aims to address the differences between control in torque and control in slip. For this purpose two models have been derived to build the optimal control problems. Both models follows the same dynamics with some simplification in the case of slip control. In fact, the dynamics of the wheels is neglected in the slip control and approximated with the longitudinal speed divided by the radius of the wheel.\\
This will produce some effects and differences in the solution of the optimal control manoeuvre.\\
The model of tyre forces is derived in two ways. The combined form that follows the magic formula of 1996 book of H.Pacejka\cite{pacejka2006tyre} and the simplified version considering a bounding ellipse on the maximum lateral and longitudinal performances.\\
In general a similar behaviour is expected with both the ellipse bound and the combined model. In fact, the terms in the combined one are derived considering the scaling due to the reciprocal performance of lateral and longitudinal.\\
All previously mentioned models are tested with different manoeuvres starting from simple ones to more complex and challenging problems. The results are reported in chapter \ref{Ch:Results} and each simulation is discussed in detail considering pros and cons of each model and the different solution techniques adopted.
