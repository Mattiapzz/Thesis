\chapter{Analysis of results}
\label{Ch:Results}
In this section several results of simulation are presented for both torque control and slip control with increasing complexity of the manoeuvres. The same approach is not effective in each situation. In fact, the following problems are characterized by high non-linearity and high sensitivity on boundary conditions. Therefore, each time, a convergence strategy is developed making large use of the continuation techniques explained in the precious chapter \ref{Ch:OCIni}.

% NOTES
% In each paragraph talk about 
% - slip and tyre control
% - how the convergence is reached
% - the boundary condition set
% - problems, key factors, differences
% - expected behaviour, unexpected behaviour
% In Track and curve try to compare trajectory to the one with the really simple model
% - Highlight differences and reasons
% - problem with the curve
% What to plot?
% - Retrieve time
% - For sure trajectories
% - velocity profiles
% - ellipses cutting out outliers--
