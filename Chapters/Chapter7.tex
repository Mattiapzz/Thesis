\chapter{Analysis of results}
\label{Ch:Results}
In this section several results of simulation are presented for both torque control and slip control with increasing complexity of the manoeuvres. The same approach is not effective in each situation. In fact, the following problems are characterized by high non-linearity and high sensitivity on boundary conditions. Therefore, each time, a convergence strategy is developed making large use of the continuation techniques explained in the precious chapter \ref{Ch:OCIni}.
